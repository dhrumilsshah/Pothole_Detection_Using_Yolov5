This is a collection of 665 images of roads with potholes labeled. 
**Note:** The original dataset did not contain a validation set; have re-shuffled the images into a [70/20/10 train-valid-test split](https://blog.roboflow.com/train-test-split).

### Usage

This dataset could be used for automatically finding and categorizing potholes in city streets so the worst ones can be fixed faster.

The dataset is provided in a wide variety of formats for various common machine learning models.
